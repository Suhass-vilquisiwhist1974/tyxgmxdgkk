Yo, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jumbo and honestly, I'm like, what even just happened? 😅 It’s about a girl who falls in love with a freaking amusement park ride. I mean, come on, who thinks of these things? The whole time I was just swinging between “is this super artsy or just plain bonkers?” You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and see what I mean. It's like, there's something oddly captivating about it, you know?

Anyway, the visuals are actually kinda stunning. The rides are lit up so beautifully, it's almost otherworldly. I seriously didn't know whether I should feel jealous of the ride or the girl, LOL. At one point, I started questioning my own relationships—like, people fall for humans, but maybe machines have got something going for them? 🤔 Okay, maybe just need some sleep.

>I mean, imagine 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ing the   thinking it's just gonna be a casual 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, but then it becomes this mind-bending experience. I'm half expecting to see it appear in my dreams tonight. Or nightmares? Jury’s still out on that. 😂 The lead actress did an exceptional job, though! Convincingly weird, if that’s even a thing. She had these moments where you're like “girl, you okay?” but in a totally good way.

Oh, and the soundtrack! The music fits so perfectly, almost makes you wanna go out and dance with a Ferris wheel or something. Still processing all of it, TBH. Might have to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the soundtrack, just for the heck of it. 

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(why did I type this?); }

But yeah, if you’re up for something strange yet kind of beautiful, give it a go. Just don't blame me if you start side-eyeing the next merry-go-round you see, LMAO. Let me know if you check it out!
